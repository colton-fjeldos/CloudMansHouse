# CloudMansHouse
"Saving Cloudman's House" is a straightforward 2D platformer with 5 levels made using the Unity Game Engine.

Each level showcases carefully crafted art, starting with a cloud city. You meet cloudman, a stranger with a celestial dilemma: his house has been stolen, and he needs you to save it! You progress through the game level by level, seeking his home. Eventually you find yourself upon the underworld. You traverse a dark kingdom, wherein you confront the Fire King in his castle. He challenges you to complete an obstacle course, after which you find yourself flying on a rocket towards the clouds. The rocket, however, misses its target, launching you into space! There, you meet an alien who offers to fly you back to the clouds, where you meet Cloudman for a final time. He's very grateful for your work and for it, he directs you to the game's conclusion.
